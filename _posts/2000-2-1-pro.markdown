* [__Making-it-rain__](https://pablo-arantes.github.io/making-it-rain/). is a Jupyter notebook scripts for running Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using OpenMM engine and AMBER and CHARMM force fields files on Google Colab. The main goal of this work is to demonstrate how to harness the power of cloud-computing to run microsecond-long MD simulations in a cheap and yet feasible fashion.
