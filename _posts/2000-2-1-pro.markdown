* __TUPÃ__ (pronounced as tu-pan) is a python algorithm that employs MDAnalysis engine to calculate electric fields at any point inside the simulation box throughout MD trajectories. TUPÃ also includes a PyMOL plugin to visualize electric field vectors together with molecules. For more information, visit: [https://github.com/mdpoleto/tupa](https://github.com/mdpoleto/tupa).
